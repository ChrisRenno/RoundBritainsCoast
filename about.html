        <h1>Round Britains Coast Permanant audax</h1>
        <p class="lead">Don Black did all the work in setting up Round Britains Coast as a 4800km audax.  He loved long distance cycling and was a (very) keen member of Peak Audax. He sadly passed away before Round Britains Coast could be completed but his wife and friends were keen for others to benefit from his tireless (bad pun intented) work for the audax community so we have put this site up to show the fruits of his labours.  It is not a permanent audax event yet but the hope is that people will ride it for the adventure in the spirit of the Radonneur.</p>
     
     <div class="col-md-8">
        
          <h2>Don's Introduction</h2>
          <p>Round Britainâ€™s Coast, a series of 200km legs right round Britain providing rides at Randonneur or Tourist level up to 4800km.  The legs may be joined together to make rides of 400km, 600km, 800km, 1000km or more at Randonneur level. If you want to do more get in touch me. I think George Berwick is the only rider to have ridden the lot in one go.  Each leg comprises start, several intermediate points and a finish and you will need to provide proof of passage at each point for validation. This may be by traditional methods, stamp, receipt, signature of resident, but you may also submit a track log from a GPS unit set up to DIY rules. To guard against total electronic failure you may choose to use a combination of the above techniques. Possibilities for proof of passage are marked for each control, sometimes available only for limited hours. ATM's at controls are only listed if 24 hour access seems likely. Traditional methods may be difficult in remote areas particularly at night for example, Thixendale, Stow, Strathcarron and Glenluce.</p>
          <p>These legs have been put together on the back of a lot of work over the years by Bernard Mawson and in particular Peter Coulson who paved the way for this current set.  Apart from the controls the route is free and it is your responsibility to ensure the route and roads taken are suitable for you. I've modified computer generated files to indicate what I remember as good cycling routes, these may be a useful starting point for choosing your own route. Your feedback will form an important way of continuing to develop this challenge ride. </p>
          <p>To allow for real life you may cycle one or more legs together in either direction before returning home to earn more money to pay the rent. There are some useful railway stations close to the start of some legs that will help you do this. I used Bournemouth, Scarborough, Alnwick, Inverness, Oban, Dumfries and Chepstow. Lots of people try and take bikes on trains these days, so make sure your bike has a reservation, particularly at Inverness and Oban. Some routes are quite remote, particularly in Scotland, and you will need to carry enough food and clothing to get you to your next stop. Finally on the road you will meet plenty of grit, potholes, wild animals and bad weather. Be careful out there!</p>

        <h2>Don Black</h2>
        <p>Don did all the work for this and was a keen Audax cyclist.  He would have hoped that people would want to use this and set themselves a little challenge and get out in the hills and whatnot. He will be sorely missed by those that new him but the audax community will be forever grateful to him for inspiring other cyclists and working tirelessly for the community.</p>
