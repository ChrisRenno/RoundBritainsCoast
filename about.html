        <p class="lead">25 200km rides right round the British Coast with many forays inland for a full touring experience. Ride this either way to clock up as much distance as you have time for. A suggested route is provided as a GPS file, but the route is free between the controls.</p>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>I rode this series of rides in 2006 and 2007. Devised by Peter Coulson they went round the outer edges of Britain, but often cut inland for a good cycling route. They were set up as a series of 24 200km rides. I noted that George Berwick had done the full set as a 5000k ride, but elected to do the rides a few days at a time. Over 2006 and 2007 I rode  the full lot having a good time and visiting many new places. There was no route sheet, just a lot of controls marked on my set of 4 mile to the inch maps. Navigation was not always easy and I was sometimes  forced off the lanes to complete the ride in time. Also finding proof of passage was sometimes nerve wracking. Now GPS machines are available that avoid unfolding maps in the rain. Mapping is available on t'internet that can provide routes for the GPS and pictures linked to the mapping indicate likely places to get proof of passage. Nowadays this can also be done using GPS evidence as well as traditional methods. As a start I've taken Peters' work and applied what I learnt from riding it to a series of files to be loaded into a GPS. I hope riders will be able to take advantage of this information to navigate easily between controls.</p>

        <h2>Don Black</h2>
        <p>Don did all the work for this and was a keen Audax cyclist.  He would have hoped that people would want to use this and set themselves a little challenge and get out in the hills and whatnot. He will be sorely missed by those that new him but the audax community will be forever grateful to him for inspiring other cyclists and working tirelessly for the community.</p>
